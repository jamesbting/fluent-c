This is a repository for the source code of my programming language, Fluent-C. It is an interpreted language built using C. Note that this language is only compatiable with Linux.

## Set up
Clone this repository to your local computer: 
```bash
https://github.com/jamesbting/fluent-c.git
```
```bash
cd fluent-c
```

Once it is finished cloning, type the following:
```bash
sudo make install
```

This will install the language globally to your system, and will allow you to use the language anywhere on your system.
